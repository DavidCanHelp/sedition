## Demo Flow

### Step 1: Network Initialization
- Creates 4-node consensus network
- Each node gets unique identity and stake
- Byzantine node (Node 3) configured for testing

### Step 2: Cryptographic Setup
- Generates Ed25519 keypairs for each node
- Creates VRF keys for leader selection
- Validates cryptographic security

### Step 3: Consensus Startup
- Activates Byzantine fault tolerant consensus
- Calculates fault tolerance parameters (f=1, n=4)
- Initializes consensus state

### Step 4: Transaction Processing
- Processes 4 sample transactions representing contributions
- Each transaction goes through full consensus pipeline
- Demonstrates leader selection and block finalization

### Step 5: Results Display
- Shows consensus performance metrics
- Displays finalized blocks and transactions
- Reports Byzantine fault tolerance status

### Step 6: Security Validation
- Validates post-quantum cryptographic readiness
- Confirms VRF security properties
- Verifies Byzantine fault tolerance
- Tests network partition recovery

### Step 7: Performance Metrics
- Measures throughput (TPS)
- Calculates average latency
- Reports resource usage
- Shows network bandwidth
