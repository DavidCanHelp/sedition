## 12. Conclusion

The Proof of Contribution consensus mechanism introduces novel security challenges due to its unique combination of stake, reputation, and code quality metrics. While this creates new attack vectors around quality manipulation and reputation gaming, it also provides additional security layers beyond traditional economic security.

Key security strengths:
- Multi-dimensional security (economic + reputation + quality)
- Byzantine fault tolerance with f < n/3
- Progressive slashing and reputation decay
- Network-level protections and monitoring

Key areas requiring continued attention:
- Quality metric gaming prevention
- Reputation system integrity
- Long-term economic incentive alignment
- Scaling security with network growth

This threat model should be regularly updated as the system evolves and new attack vectors are discovered. Community participation in security research and vulnerability disclosure is essential for maintaining system security over time.
